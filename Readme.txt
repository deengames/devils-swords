1) What is Devil's Swords?
It's a role-playing game teaser in the style of the old 2D RPGs of the late 90s, inspired by the AlMaghrib slogan of "give your excuses a black eye."  Now, you can literally give them a black eye!

2) How do I play?
Use the arrow keys to walk around.  Press enter or space to interact with people, menus, etc.  Escape backs out, or pulls up the main menu.  You start out as the Crystal of Choosing--you can choose your gender (male or female) for your character.

3) What do I need to run this game?
The minimum is probably a 800MHz CPU (so, a Pentium III or IV), but you can run it on a Pentium II 400MHz PC.

4) I get stuck on XYZ!
Chances are you're missing something.  There's armour you can buy (or find), and an inn where you can rest to restore your health.  It's impossible to beat the game without using one of the two.

5) Awesome!  I want MORE!
Did you get the YEEEEEAH at the end of the game?  If not, you're missing something!
If you did--and you honestly liked the game and would like to see more (like a full version instead of a teaser)--email us (games@youngmuslims.ca) and let us know!  Or better yet, visit www.ashiq.ca/ascension to see if there have been any updates.

6) I have a great idea for you!
Ideas are great!  Fortunately for us, they're not copyrightable--so drop us a line (games@youngmuslims.ca) and let us know.  We'd love to incorporate them into the next one, bi idhnillah.
